## Etymology

Cosmos Ocean is a fan-made archetype that was created for [YGOPro](http://www.ygopro.co/). This archetype contains a list of WATER monsters that work together on swarming the field and synchro summoning.
The names of these cards are inspired by [The 7 Spiritual Laws of Success](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven_Spiritual_Laws_of_Success). Most of the monster effects are related to one of the laws
assigned to the card. **Cosmos Ocean - Karma** (card above) is an example of such:

>When this card is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard: You can destroy the monster that destroyed it.

## Playing Style

Since they are all related by name, they all share very similiar effects. One Pendulum effect that all Cosmos Ocean cards share is the following:
>You cannot Special Summon monsters, except WATER monsters.


The non-Synchro Pendulum Monsters share the following effect:
>You can only control 1 "Cosmos Ocean - ###"


The Synchro Pendulum Monsters share the following effect:
>If this card in the Monster Zone is destroyed: You can place this card in your Pendulum Zone.


The Fusion Pendulum Monsters share the following effect:
>When this card is Fusion Summoned: You can equip 1 Level 1 WATER monster from your Deck or face-up from your Extra Deck to this card. This card gains ATK and DEF equal to the monster equipped by this effect. If this card would be destroyed while equipped with an WATER monster(s), you can destroy 1 of those cards instead.

As of the 1.3 update this archetype can be broken down into several different category of Monsters. Each category has their own strengths and weaknesses.

#### Strengths
- Strong swarming ability
- Multiple Synchro Summon combinations

- Pendulum Summons are done with ease
- Snowballing is possible with the right combinations (see video)

#### Weaknesses
- Cards rely on each other too much
- Limited salvaging mechanics
- Defense is a weakness and depends too much on Synchro Monsters
- Self-Destruction is a possibility, but is required if you want to use your Synchro Pendulum Monster effects.
- Despite some of the Synchro Monsters having strong Pendulum effects, it's a liability to get them in your Pendulum zone.

### Generic Cosmos Fusion (Strict Cosmos Ocean Fusion Playstyle)
